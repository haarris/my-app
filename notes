package.json:
"react scripts" automates a lot of the webpack/babel
stuff so we don't have to deal with it, the four commands
below: 
    -   "start" - starts the project
    -   "build" - converts into ready made static files
    -   "test"
    -   "eject" - take out config babel files if we want to tinker oursleves

Folders:
"src" source folder is where all our code goes
"public" all our browser files, "build" converts them into
static files for public folder
